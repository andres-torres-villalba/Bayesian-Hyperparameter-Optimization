# Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization

"""The Hyperparameter Optimization uses the acquisition funtion
(maximize this to improve the GP)

EI(x) = E [max {0,f8x9 - f(^x)}] ,

 Gaussian Process uses a set of previously evaluated parameters and resulting accuracy to make 
 an assumption about unobserved parameters. Acquisition Function using this information suggest 
 the next set of parameters."""
